# Tic-Tac-Toe: scala homework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivan-gerasin/scala_tic_tac_toe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ivan-gerasin/scala_tic_tac_toe)

This is just a kind of pet project where I'm trying to learn scala by implementing
any new functional which want to try. Highly likely there is not any interesting for you,
but just in case, of how am I doing it, here is my plan for it:

Done (including tests)
* Implement core and basic functional: just game with 2 player on 3*3 sized board

In progress:
* CLI version of this game, with at least save/load functional
* It should have tests - try scalatest and scalamock (and all future code)!

Planned: 
* Make a simple AI (not even smart) just to be able to play with human or not
* Implement GUI version using existing code without rewriting core part (which is used by CLI version)
* Improve AI or 3*3 board
* Allow bigger boards (may be different win rules)
* Allow custom marks on boards
* Improve AI to work with bigger boards and different win rules
* Network version
* Web version
